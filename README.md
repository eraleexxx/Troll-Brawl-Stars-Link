# 🎭 Brawl Stars Free Pin Troll Website  

## ⚠️ Warning: This is a prank website!  

### 📝 Description  
This is a **troll project** designed to trick users into believing they can claim a free Brawl Stars pin. The landing page is an **exact copy of Supercell's original website**, making it look as convincing as possible. However, once the user clicks the "Claim" button, they are redirected to a different page **entirely created by me**, where a **VERY LOUD sound** plays to give them a good scare.  

### 🎯 Purpose  
This is just a harmless joke meant to **prank friends or curious users**. The website does **not steal data**, **does not install malware**, and **does not perform any malicious actions**—it only plays a loud sound for fun.  

### ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The **fake landing page** looks identical to an official Supercell website.  
2. The user clicks on the "Claim Free Pin" button.  
3. Instead of receiving a pin, they are redirected to my custom **prank page**.  
4. A **VERY LOUD** sound plays to scare them.  

### 🚀 Usage  
If you share this website, **use it responsibly** and **make sure the victim has their volume turned up** for the best effect. **Enjoy trolling! 😈**
